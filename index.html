        Died: April 4th, 1968 <br /><br />Martin Luther King, Jr., is known for
        his contributions to the American civil rights movement in the 1960s.
        His most famous work is his “I Have a Dream” (1963) speech, in which he
        spoke of his dream of a United States that is void of segregation and
        racism. King also advocated for nonviolent methods of protest. King was
        largely responsible for the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and
        the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The Civil Rights Act banned
        discrimination in the workforce and public accommodations based on race,
        color, religion, or national origin. Sadly, on Thursday, April 4, 1968,
        King was shot while standing on a balcony outside his second-ﬂoor room
        at the Lorraine Motel.

        in social movements for civil rights, socialism, nonviolence, and gay
        rights. Rustin worked with A. Philip Randolph on the March on Washington
        Movement, in 1941, to press for an end to racial discrimination in
        employment. Rustin was an indispensable force behind the Civil Rights
        Movement and he was openly gay. Rustin traveled to Ghana, Nigeria and
        South Africa, advising leaders on their planned nonviolent civil
        disobedience campaigns for liberation and later helped organize the
        Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament's first annual protest march in
        England.

        Born: February 4, 1913<br />
        Died: October 24, 2005 <br /><br />Rosa Louise McCauley Parks was an
        American activist in the civil rights movement best known for her
        pivotal role in the Montgomery bus boycott. The United States Congress
        has called her "the first lady of civil rights" and "the mother of the
        freedom movement" On Thursday, December 1, 1955, the 42-year-old Rosa
        Parks was commuting home from a long day of work at the Montgomery Fair
        department store by bus. Black residents of Montgomery often avoided
        municipal buses if possible because they found the Negroes-in-back
        policy so demeaning. Nonetheless, 70 percent or more riders on a typical
        day were Black, and on this day Rosa Parks was one of them.
